All of the functionalities within our program work accordingly. For our text-based interface, users are able to create a portfolio, save portfolios, and load portfolios. In addition, our text-based interface also has managing portfolio functionalities which all work as well. These functionalities include buying stocks, selling stocks, calculating portfolio values, retrieving portfolio compositions, and retrieving portfolio distributions. In addition, users can also calculate moving day averages, detect crossovers, calculate gain/loss, rebalance their portfolio, and view a performance chart for their portfolio. To reiterate, all of these functionalities are within our text-based interface. In terms of our GUI interface, all functionalities that we were expected to implement work accordingly as well. When running our program with the command line, our GUI pops up correctly and displays all the functionalities in the main menu. The GUI contains seven functionalities. In our GUI interface, users can successfully create a portfolio, buy/sell stocks to that portfolio, query the value of their portfolio's value and composition at a certain date, and save/load portfolios from files. Therefore, all of the functionalities in our program, in our text-based interface and GUI interface, work as expected based on the instructions we were given.
